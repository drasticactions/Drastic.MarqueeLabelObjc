# Drastic.MarqueeLabelObjC

Drastic.MarqueeLabelObjC is binding of [MarqueeLabel^ObjC](https://github.com/cbpowell/MarqueeLabel-ObjC), a subclass of UILabel that adds scrolling marquee support.

This is based on the older version of the library, as it's easier to do the binding to Objc rather than Swift. While that is doable via a proxy, this version should be good enough as a proof of concept.
